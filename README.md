# JobDescAnalytica

JobDescAnalytica is an open-source project that leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze job descriptions. It extracts keywords, calculates TF-IDF scores, and evaluates the similarity between job descriptions using cosine similarity, euclidean distance, and Jaccard similarity metrics. This toolkit is particularly useful for HR analytics, job market analysis, and understanding key skill requirements across various roles.

## Features
- **Keyword Extraction**: Utilize TF-IDF vectorization for extracting significant keywords from job descriptions.
- **Similarity Calculation**: Compute cosine similarity between various job descriptions to find related roles.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare text data for NLP tasks.
